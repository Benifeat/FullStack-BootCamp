# Bootcamp Experience
## Background

Before starting the bootcamp, I had experience with various programming languages including C, Java, and C#. With this solid foundation, I decided to dive into the world of full-stack development. Despite being familiar with programming concepts, I had not yet explored JavaScript and web technologies like HTML and CSS.

## Transition to Full-Stack Development

The transition to web development was smooth, as many programming languages share similar principles and differ mainly in syntax. Initially, I was a novice in both frontend and backend web development. However, as I progressed through the bootcamp, I discovered my passion for full-stack development. This realization motivated me to invest additional hours in self-study.

## Learning Journey

Within the first few months of the course, I rapidly acquired skills in various technologies:

   * Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React
   * Backend: Node.js, Express
   * Databases: MongoDB, SQL
   * Other Technologies: REST APIs, Python

## Intensive Learning

The bootcamp was an intensive full-time program, totaling approximately 1500+ hours of learning. About 1000 hours were dedicated to in-class instruction, while the remaining hours were self-directed study. This rigorous schedule allowed me to not only grasp the core concepts of the MERN stack but also to delve deeper into each technology.
